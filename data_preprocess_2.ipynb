    "### Explanation of Each Data Component and Calculation Method\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Raw EDA (Electrodermal Activity)\n",
    "The raw EDA signal captures the fluctuations in skin conductance, typically measured in microsiemens (\\(\\mu S\\)). This signal directly reflects changes in skin conductance and is the foundation for subsequent computations. It is obtained directly from the sensors measuring skin conductance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tonic EDA\n",
    "Tonic EDA represents the long-term baseline level of skin conductance, indicating overall trends in skin conductance levels. This is a low-frequency component obtained by applying a **low-pass filter** to the raw EDA signal. A low-pass filter allows signals with a frequency lower than a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while attenuating frequencies higher than the cutoff. The formula can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Tonic EDA} = \\text{Low-pass filter}(\\text{Raw EDA}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In `NeuroKit2`, this component is derived by smoothing or decomposing the raw signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phasic EDA\n",
    "Phasic EDA reflects : $\\textbf{rapid, transient changes in skin conductance, often associated with responses to specific stimuli or emotional reactions.}$ This high-frequency component is obtained by subtracting the tonic component from the raw EDA signal, which can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Phasic EDA} = \\text{Raw EDA} - \\text{Tonic EDA}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A **high-pass filter** is used to isolate this component, allowing frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency to pass while attenuating lower frequencies. In `NeuroKit2`, the `eda_process` function automatically computes this by separating the raw signal into its tonic and phasic components.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SCR Peaks (Skin Conductance Response Peaks)\n",
    "SCR Peaks represent the significant peaks in the phasic EDA component, indicating notable physiological responses to specific events. The detection process includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Signal Decomposition**: Extracting the phasic EDA from the raw signal.\n",
    "2. **Peak Detection**: Applying a peak detection algorithm to identify prominent local maxima in the phasic EDA signal, which correspond to sudden increases in skin conductance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `NeuroKit2`, these peaks are automatically detected and calculated using the `eda_process` and `eda_findpeaks` functions. The peaks indicate significant physiological reactions that can be used to study responses to stimuli or emotional changes.\n"
